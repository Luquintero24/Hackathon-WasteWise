# wastewise

Inspiration
The inspiration for this project stemmed from the pressing need to address the environmental impact of excess production in industries. Witnessing the significant waste generated due to overproduction, we were motivated to develop an AI solution that could help companies optimize their production processes and minimize their environmental footprint.

What it does
The developed AI model, named "Less Waste, More Profit," accurately predicts the optimal quantity of products a company should produce in order to minimize waste while maximizing profits. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques and data analytics to analyze historical production data, market trends, and other relevant factors. By providing real-time recommendations, the model empowers companies to make informed decisions about their production levels.

How we built it
We utilized a Python-based programming environment and leveraged machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset containing production records, demand patterns, and waste data. Feature engineering played a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from the data. Additionally, we implemented a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and integration into existing production workflows.
